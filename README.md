# sparta-global-portfolio

## Summary

This is a personal portfolio example site to demonstrate effective use of responsive CSS.

This was set as homework over day 2 and 3 of the Sparta Global training and was presented to the class on day 4.

## Design

The site is designed from a mobile first perspective and should display properly across all device types.

It makes use of Bootstrap and the grid system for its style and layout.


## Features

* The static nav bar is a dropdown list on mobile devices which changes to fully laid out links on larger screens.

## Requirements

* The correct versions of Bootstrap 3.3.7 and JQuery 3.3.1 are included via CDN links.
